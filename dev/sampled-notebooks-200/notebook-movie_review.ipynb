      "every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody ' s surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling . mtv films ' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example . did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ? the plot is deceptively simple . george washington carver high school is having student elections . tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over - achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high . mr . \" m \" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular - but - slow jock to run . and paul ' s nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons . the dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be . you can ' t help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have . _election , a good film , does not live up to its hype . what makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier . the similarities are staggering : tracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . max fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . the most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . the most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . tracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive . max fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive . the male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . he even gets a bee sting . the male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . he gets several bee stings . and so on . what happened ? how is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn ' t been fully formed yet ? even so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul ' s anti - social sister , tammy . broderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he ' s had since then . witherspoon is a revelation . it ' s early in the year , it ' s a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination . and once campbell ' s character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you ' re won over . one thing that ' s been bothering me since i ' ve seen it . there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film . i suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . . but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom . as the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story . it is bad enough that mr . m doesn ' t like tracy ' s determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student / teacher relationship ? even so , there ' s no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does . there ' s a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex - driven , mark this as a disappointment .\n"
