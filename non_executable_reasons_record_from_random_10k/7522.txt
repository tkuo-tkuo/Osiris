# In this assignment you are going to work with Pandas
# what is assessed is your ability to work with documentation
# overall you need to write 5 lines of code
# Go through the following code line by line and complete
# the functions fill_na and embed_categories

#        Taks Description
# In current task you are going to do data pre-processing for KNN algorithm.
# KNN with euclidean distance metric is designed to work only with numerical features
# You are going to test KNN on modified Titanic dataset. You can get familiar with
# dataset header in the file titanic_modified.csv

# You are going to complete two types of pre-processing:
# 1. Eliminating Null (N/A) values
# 2. Mapping categorical features to binary indicator features
